## Purpose 

This repository will provide a method to create multiple Google Groups to force a conflicting account for former employees who created personal Google Identities with their corporate email address. The benefit of creating a Google group rather than a Google user identity is the following:  

1. Creating an identity for former employee will create policy issues for most organizations.
1. Avoids using a license (Cloud Identity or Workspace) for a former employee.

If you have no idea what a conflict account is the best guide is found [here](https://www.goldyarora.com/google-conflicting-accounts-guide/).

## Prerequisites
